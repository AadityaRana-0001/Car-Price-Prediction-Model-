ðŸš— Car Price Prediction Model
This project involves building a Machine Learning-based system to accurately predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as make, model, manufacturing year, mileage, engine type, and more.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Data Collection & Cleaning: Gathered and cleaned a dataset containing detailed information about used cars to ensure high data quality.

Feature Engineering: Extracted and transformed key attributes such as age of the vehicle, brand popularity, and fuel efficiency to improve model performance.

Model Training: Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms including:

Linear Regression for baseline predictions

Random Forest Regressor for capturing non-linear relationships

XGBoost Regressor for optimized, high-performance prediction

Performance: Achieved up to 90% accuracy in price prediction based on model tuning and validation.

Evaluation: Used metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score to assess and compare model performance.

Pipeline Development: Created a robust end-to-end pipeline for data preprocessing, training, testing, and evaluation to ensure a seamless and reproducible workflow.

ðŸ§  Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be used to tackle real-world regression problems, with a focus on efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability.
